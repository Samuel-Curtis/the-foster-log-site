    <p>
        The Foster Log is an android mobile application built for people who foster animals in their home. 
        They can use this app to keep track of all the animals they have helped. 
        Each foster that they add in the app will have their own profile where users can log experiences with images to look back on at any time.
        The goal is to allow foster parents to save and revisit memories of all the animals they have helped.
